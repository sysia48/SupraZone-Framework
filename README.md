# SupraZone Framework

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/suprazone-framework.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/suprazone-framework/)
[![CI](https://github.com/sysia48/SupraZone-Framework/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sysia48/SupraZone-Framework/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**SupraZone** is a physics-inspired, zero-entropy analytical engine designed to model, analyze, and visualize spiral resonance dynamics across temporal domains. The framework integrates harmonic oscillation modeling, gradient-based phase interference, entropic stabilization, non-linear tunneling dynamics, FFT spectral decomposition, and energy heatmap mapping to reveal how resonance patterns emerge, modulate, drift, stabilize, and achieve Ω-closure.

## Installation

```bash
pip install suprazone-framework
```

## Quick Start

```python
from suprazone import SupraZone

# Initialize the framework
sz = SupraZone()

# Run spiral resonance analysis
results = sz.analyze()
print(results)
```
